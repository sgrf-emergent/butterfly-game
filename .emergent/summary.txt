The trajectory details the development of a butterfly identification mobile app from scratch. The initial phase involved setting up a full-stack application using Expo for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. The AI engineer first clarified the product requirements, deciding to implement Phase 1 with pre-populated mock data for 30 butterflies and a light green theme, deferring admin features.

The initial build included creating backend endpoints to serve butterfly data and a frontend with home, game, and results screens. However, a critical bug was reported by the user: images were not displaying correctly on the game screen. The debugging process was extensive. The engineer first verified the backend API and image URL accessibility, ruling out server-side issues. The  was correctly invoked, identifying a dark overlay in the CSS as the root cause. When removing the overlay didn't fully resolve the issue (images remained black), the engineer correctly pivoted to a more robust solution, replacing the standard React Native  component with . This successfully loaded the images, although they appeared blurred in the web preview, a known artifact.

Finally, the user requested a UI tweak to the home screen logo. The engineer first attempted a direct style change, then correctly identified the issue as the image's embedded background and implemented a successful workaround by styling the logo's container to blend with the theme. The work concluded after verifying this final change.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a butterfly identification game for iOS and Android.

**Phase 1 (Completed):**
A simple quiz game.
- **Start Screen:** Displays the HM logo and a Start button.
- **Game Flow:**
    - A random butterfly photo is shown for 5 seconds.
    - Five multiple-choice options (Common and Latin names) appear.
    - The user has 10 seconds to answer.
    - Instant feedback (Correct or Wrong) is provided. If wrong, the correct answer is shown.
    - A Next button proceeds to the next question.
- **Scoring:** The score (e.g., 1/10) is displayed at the top right.
- **End Screen:** After 10 questions, a final score is shown with a Play Again option.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Data:** The app was built with pre-populated data for 30 realistic butterfly species.
- **Theme:** A light green garden theme has been applied.
- **Assets:** The provided HM logo is used on the home screen.
- **Login:** No user login is required for Phase 1.

**Phase 2 (Pending):**
- **Admin Panel:** Features for uploading butterfly photos/videos, setting difficulty levels, and managing display times.
- **User Features:** Usernames to save scores and the ability to select a difficulty level.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks:** Expo (React Native) for the cross-platform mobile app, FastAPI (Python) for the backend.
- **Database:** MongoDB for data storage, pre-populated with butterfly data.
- **Routing:** File-based routing using .
- **Image Handling:** Switched from 's default  component to  to resolve web rendering and loading issues.
- **Styling:**  for all component styling, with a focus on a cohesive light-green theme.
- **Debugging:** Utilized a  to diagnose a visual bug related to an image overlay.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack monorepo structure with a  and  directory.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This file contains the FastAPI backend logic. It connects to MongoDB and defines the API endpoints that the frontend consumes.
    - **Changes:** Created to serve two main endpoints:  to list all butterflies (for data seeding) and  to provide a single, randomly selected butterfly along with four incorrect options for the quiz. The backend was tested and confirmed to be working correctly.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the entry point and home screen of the app. It displays the logo, a butterfly image, and the Start button to begin the game.
    - **Changes:**
        - Created to be the initial landing page.
        - The  component was updated from  to  for better performance and consistency.
        - The styling for the HM logo container was modified multiple times. The final implementation styles the container with a light green background (), padding, and  to blend the logo (which has an embedded white background) into the app's theme.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This file contains the core game logic, including state management for the current question, score, timers, user selections, and feedback.
    - **Changes:**
        - A major debugging effort occurred here. An initial dark overlay () that was causing images to appear black was removed.
        - To fix persistent image loading issues on the web, the standard  component was replaced with  from the  library. This resolved the problem of images not appearing.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This screen is displayed after the user completes 10 questions. It shows the final score and provides an option to restart the game.
    - **Changes:** Created as part of the initial application build to complete the game loop. No major fixes were required for this file.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Phase 2 Implementation:**
    - Build the Admin Panel for managing butterfly data (photos, videos, names, difficulty).
    - Implement user accounts for saving scores.
    - Add a difficulty selection feature for users.
    - Enable voice recognition for selecting answers.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recently completed task was a user-requested UI adjustment on the home screen (). The user wanted to remove the white background from the HM logo to better match the app's light green garden theme.

The initial investigation revealed that the white background was part of the logo image file itself, so simply changing the component's  style was ineffective.

The implemented solution was to apply styling to the logo's parent  container. This container was given the same light green background color as the page (), along with  and . This change makes the square logo image appear more integrated and cohesive with the overall design, effectively removing the harsh white box effect.

The code change in  was:

This work has been completed and verified via a screenshot. The app is considered fully functional for Phase 1.

<optional_next_step>
Now that Phase 1 is complete and the final UI tweak is done, I will ask you for the next steps. Are you happy with the current state, or shall we begin working on the Phase 2 features?
