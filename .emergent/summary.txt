The trajectory details the initial implementation of an admin panel for a butterfly identification app, marking the beginning of Phase 2 development. The user's request was to start with admin panel and keep it simple for now.

Following user confirmation of a detailed plan, the AI engineer executed a structured workflow. First, it augmented the FastAPI backend by adding a new  with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing butterflies (). These new endpoints were then successfully validated using the  agent.

Next, the engineer scaffolded the frontend. This involved creating two new files for the admin section:  to list butterflies and  as a placeholder for the add/edit form. The navigation was updated in  to include these new routes, and a button was added to the home screen () to provide an entry point to the admin panel.

The work concluded after visually verifying that the Admin button navigates correctly and that the admin list page successfully fetches and displays butterfly data from the new backend endpoint. The add/edit functionality remains to be implemented.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a butterfly identification mobile game. Phase 1, a simple quiz game, is complete. The current work focuses on Phase 2, beginning with an Admin Panel.

The user approved a plan to build a simple, unauthenticated admin panel for managing the butterfly database. The requirements for this initial version include:

**Backend:**
-   API endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on butterflies.

**Frontend:**
-   An Admin button on the main home screen.
-   A new screen () to list all butterflies from the database.
-   A form screen () for adding and editing butterfly details (Common Name, Latin Name, Image, Difficulty).

The implementation so far has established the backend endpoints and the basic frontend structure for the admin list view, fulfilling the initial part of the approved plan. The form for creating/editing butterflies is the next piece to be built.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI for creating a new  with CRUD endpoints.
- **Frontend:** Expo (React Native) with  for file-based routing and navigation.
- **Architecture:** Full-stack development, separating backend API logic from frontend UI components.
- **Process:** Systematic workflow of backend implementation, frontend scaffolding, service restarts (backend                          STOPPING

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct  and  directories. The recent work expanded this structure by adding an admin section.



- ****
    - **Importance:** The core of the backend API. It handles all data interactions with the MongoDB database.
    - **Summary of changes:** New CRUD endpoints were added under an  prefix to manage butterflies. This includes functions for getting all butterflies, adding a new one, and updating/deleting an existing one by its ID. These endpoints are separate from the public-facing game endpoints.

- ** (New File)**
    - **Importance:** This is the main dashboard for the Admin Panel. It's the first screen an admin sees.
    - **Summary of changes:** Created to fetch and display a list of all butterflies from the  endpoint. It currently renders a scrollable list showing the butterfly's common name, Latin name, and image. The basic UI and data fetching are complete.

- ** (New File)**
    - **Importance:** This file is intended to be the form for creating a new butterfly or editing an existing one.
    - **Summary of changes:** The file was created as a placeholder. The UI, form state management, and logic to interact with the / backend endpoints have not been implemented yet.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The app's home screen and primary entry point for users.
    - **Summary of changes:** A new Admin button () was added. This button uses 's  component to navigate the user to the  screen.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The root layout file for the app, which configures the global navigation structure using 's .
    - **Summary of changes:** Two new  entries were added for  and  to make these new pages discoverable by the navigator.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Admin Panel Completion:**
    - Implement the UI for the Add/Edit butterfly form on the  screen.
    - Add functionality for image picking/uploading using .
    - Connect the form to the backend to handle creating and updating butterflies.
- **Phase 2 User Features:**
    - Implement user accounts to save scores.
    - Add a difficulty selection feature for the game.
    - Explore voice recognition for answering questions.

<current_work>
The current work focused on initiating Phase 2 by building the foundational elements of a simple Admin Panel, as requested by the user.

A complete set of CRUD endpoints for managing butterflies was implemented in the FastAPI backend () and successfully tested. These endpoints operate under the  route prefix.

On the frontend, the navigation was updated to support the new admin section. This involved:
1.  Adding an Admin button to the home screen () that links to the admin panel.
2.  Creating the admin landing page (), which fetches and displays a list of butterflies. This page is functional and has been visually verified.
3.  Creating a placeholder file () for the future Add/Edit Butterfly form.

The work concluded after successfully restarting the services and using screenshots to confirm that the Admin button works and the admin list page correctly displays data from the backend. The core read functionality of the admin panel is complete, but create/update functionality is not yet implemented on the frontend.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to build the frontend for the Add/Edit Butterfly screen (), including the form UI and logic to connect with the backend.
